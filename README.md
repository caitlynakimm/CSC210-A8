## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?
- The most challenging parts of this assignment was learning how to insert new nodes in a decision tree and also how to write/overwrite and read and reconstruct a tree from a text file. For me, I think the most interesting aspects about this assignment was seeing the decision tree grow from the user's input and noticing the file being updated with the user's new questions and animal names. Also, I thought it was really clever to look at the path string minus the last character of a child node to find its parent node.
